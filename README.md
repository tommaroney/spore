The application is running on an EC2 instance backed by and RDS database with an S3 bucket collecting and serving images.

Locally the application can be run with a MySQL server, but will need to be connected an S3 bucket for a functioning Admin page.  This is as easy as creating an S3 Bucket in the AWS Console and creating an IAM user with permissions to administrate the bucket.  Save a copy of the Key ID and the Secret Access Key.  After this is completed be sure the aws-cli tool has been installed and run aws configure.  Provide the requested information.

Create environment variables either in a .env file in the root folder: 

~~~~
dev_USERNAME = *yourUsername*
dev_PASSWORD = *yourPassword*
dev_HOST = *hostAddress*
dev_DATABASE = *yourDatabase*
~~~~


npm install
npm install --dev

run the node server to create tables in the database
end the server instance

make sure `sequelize-cli` is installed

run `npx sequelize-cli db:seed:all` from the terminal to seed the attributes and icons table

restart node server
